.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In lua.h
.Ft void
.Fn lua_pushcclosure "lua_State *L" "lua_CFunction fn" "int n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn lua_pushcclosure
pushes a new C closure onto the stack.
.Pp
When a C function is created, it is possible to associate some values with it,
thus creating a C closure; these values are then accessible to the function
whenever it is called.
To associate values with a C function, first these values should be pushed onto
the stack (when there are multiple values, the first value is pushed first).
Then
.Fn lua_pushcclosure
is called to create and push the C function onto the stack, with the argument
.Fa n
telling how many values should be associated with the function.
.Fn lua_pushcclosure
also pops these values from the stack.
.Pp
The maximum value for
.Fa n
is 255.
